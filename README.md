# txt2Chinese
   * The program can transform single-byte characters to double-byte characters, and it will transform some CJK complementary radicals and KangXi radicals to real Chinese words.<br>
 For example, the decimal base of single-byte 'a' is 97 but the decimal base of double-byte 'a' is 65345, and maybe there are some radicals in the txt to represent a Chinese word such as the decimal base of radical '一' is 12032 but the decimal base of radical '一' is 19968.<br>
The program will get a formal Chinese text.<br>
